<h2>Full-Stack Web Developer / Go Programmer</h2>

<hr>
<br>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am currently looking to make a career restart towards software development. I have extensive background in
    Microsoft Office applications and Google Suite for over fifteen years. In more recent years, I have been studying
    programming languages, such as Go, Java, and JavaScript. My interest in programming started at a young age with
    HTML, Dreamweaver, and creating my own simple websites. Now, I would like to pursue a career as a Go Developer.
</p>
<p>My best qualities are my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am an excellent professional
    communicator, team player, and a natural leader. I pride myself on my lifelong love of learning and continuous
    improvement. I find strength and growth in acknowledging when I have made a mistake, and finding ways to learn and
    grow from such occurrences.
